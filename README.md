## Overview

### Brief

- **Solo project**,
- **1 week timeframe**,
- **Build a full-stack application** by making your own Back-End and your own Front-End,
- **Use a Django (with Python) back-end API** to serve your data from a **PostgreSQL database**,
- **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with **React**,
- **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and **CRUD functionality** for at least a couple of models,
- **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut,
- **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this,
- **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible,

I created Momen2um, a productivity app inspired by a Chrome Extension that I am currently using, Momentum but with additional features tailored for myself i.e. music player, news app, workout timer and a 'to-do' list.

This application is designed to be the 'one-stop' location for anyone looking for productivity during the day with everything from news articles and music player all in one place, removing distractions and the need for users to go onto any other internet pages. Users can also register and log in which will allow any 'to-do' items and custom 'workouts' to be saved and added onto a personal 'to-do' list. Additional features include a 10 minute workout timer which is pre-programmed to start every hour which ties in with the main aim of the app, 'Get Productive or Get Fit trying...' Although, for those that just want to focus on working, there is a 'Do not disturb' mode which will just continue counting down the time to the end of the day without the 'workout mode' being triggered.

    - ReactJS,
    - HTML5,
    - SCSS (with Bulma framework),
- Back-End:
    - Django (with Python),
    - PostgreSQL (SQL database),
- General:
    - Github,
    - Insomnia (Back-End Testing),
    - TablePlus GUI (Back-End SQL database testing),
    - Figma (Wireframe),

- Halfmoon (Dropdown and popover),

## External APIs

This application uses external APIs, in order to enjoy the full experience of this application,  please use the deployed version here (add link to deployed app) or to run it locally, you will need to sign up for an API key from each of the following links:

- [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/guide) (Weather info. for Citites),
- [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation#getting-started) (Background image for application),
- [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started) (News articles),
- Quotes API?

## Planning

- Figma for initial wireframe (+images here),
- Trello for task planning and tracking (+images here),
- Researched and finalised the main frameworks and libraries to use,
- ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) for database planning,
- RESTful Routes for Back-end (+images of using Insomnia),
-

### MVP

- Register and Login User functionality:
    - Ability to create a workout with 'preset' list of exercises,
    - Ability to add + remove items (or on 'To-do list'?),
- To-do list:
    - Ability to add + remove items,
    - Add workout,
- Countdown timer (from midnight),
